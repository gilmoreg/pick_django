# Pick-Django
by [Grayson Gilmore](https://github.com/gilmoreg/).

[See the live site here](https://pick-django.herokuapp.com/).

## Summary
This is a Python/Django port of [Pick.moe](https://github.com/gilmoreg/pick). This is my first ever Django app and I think it turned out well despite not knowing much Python going in. I'm proud to say that while I may not know Python well, I at least have my feet wet and could easily pick up more if required. It was really fun and I would look forward to the challenge!

Please see the [original project](https://github.com/gilmoreg/pick) for details about the app's purpose and main functionality.
